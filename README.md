# Unhandled Exceptions in Asynchronous Network Requests

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart when performing asynchronous network requests: the lack of robust error handling.  The `bug.dart` file shows the initial code with insufficient exception handling.  `bugSolution.dart` provides improved error handling and demonstrates best practices.

## Problem

The original code only prints a generic error message. In a production environment, more specific error handling is essential for debugging and providing informative feedback to users.  There's a lack of distinguishing between different types of network errors or other exceptions that might occur during the data processing.

## Solution

The solution includes:

- **Specific Error Handling:**  Categorizing errors based on `response.statusCode` allows tailored responses.  For example, HTTP 404 (Not Found) can provide a more specific error message compared to a generic connection error.
- **Custom Exceptions:** Creating custom exceptions can provide more context and information for debugging. 
- **Error Reporting:**  In a real application, logging detailed error messages would be critical for troubleshooting.
